### Software and Libraries ###
[Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/)

Robot Simulator

[ROS](http://www.ros.org/)

The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It is a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robotic platforms.

[RobWork](http://www.robwork.dk/jrobwork/)

RobWork is a collection of C++ libraries for simulation and control of robot systems. RobWork is used for research and education as well as for practical robot applications.

[MRPT](http://www.mrpt.org/)

Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit provides developers with portable and well-tested applications and libraries covering data structures and algorithms employed in common robotics research areas.

[Robotics Library](http://www.roboticslibrary.org/)

The Robotics Library (RL) is a self-contained C++ library for robot kinematics, motion planning and control. It covers mathematics, kinematics and dynamics, hardware abstraction, motion planning, collision detection, and visualization.

[Simbad](http://simbad.sourceforge.net/)

2D/3D simulator in Java and Jython.

[Morse](https://www.openrobots.org/wiki/morse/)

General purpose indoor/outdoor 3D simulator.

[Carmen](http://carmen.sourceforge.net/)

CARMEN is an open-source collection of software for mobile robot control. CARMEN is modular software designed to provide basic navigation pri
matives including: base and sensor control, logging, obstacle avoidance, localization, path planning, and mapping.

[Peekabot](http://www.peekabot.org/)

Peekabot is a real-time, networked 3D visualization tool for robotics, written in C++. Its purpose is to simplify the visualization needs faced by a roboticist daily.

[YARP](http://www.yarp.it/)

Yet Another Robot Platform.

[V-REP](http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/)

Robot simulator, 3D, source available, Lua scripting, APIs for C/C++, Python, Java, Matlab, URBI, 2 physics engines, full kinematic solver.
